## Overview

Understanding the pathways underlying a disease is crucial to the drug discovery process. Pathways are a series of tightly regulated molecular reactions that determine a cellâ€™s state. When these pathways are disrupted, it leads to disease. To be effective, a new drug must minimize or remedy this disruption, driving the state of the cell closer to the healthy state. Pathway understanding plays a role in multiple parts of the drug discovery process:

**Target Identification**  
Drug discovery scientists use their understanding of disease pathways to identify new drug targets. By examining how the pathway is disrupted, they can select targets within the pathway to modulate.

**Target Validation**

**Indication Expansion**  
Furthermore, the same pathway can be disrupted in multiple diseases, even diseases in different therapeutic areas. Understanding the role of a pathway in multiple diseases can help with drug repositioning or repurposing efforts.

Currently, the Syntensor platform
